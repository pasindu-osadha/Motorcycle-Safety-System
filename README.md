This project is an ATmega32 Microcontroller based project. The project was done for the level 1 Hardware project.

Day by day number of motorcycle accidents are getting increase around the country. Motorcyclist carelessness is the major reason that can be affected by these accidents. Speed driving, drunk driving and riding with no helmet protection are the common mistakes that are done by the riders. If the rider has met such an accident, his closest ones cannot get any information about him and the location of the accident. The motorcycle is easy to carry, and it can be stolen by someone.
